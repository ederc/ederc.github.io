<h2 style="display:inline;">My Research Interests</h2> &nbsp;&nbsp; focus on (but are not restricted to)
<h3>Computer algebra,</h3>
<h3>Symbolic computation,</h3>
<h3>Polynomial system solving</h3>
<br>
and all its various applications in <b>Algebraic geometry</b>, <b>Cryptography</b>, <b>Robotics</b> and many many more.

<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
<p>
Modern computers paired with sophisticated mathematical software tools
allow for success stories in mathematics and its application areas which were
previously unimaginable. Taking center stage in science, engineering, and
industry, effective computational methods have become an integral part of
our daily lives. Somewhat masked by the ubiquity of tools based on fast
linear algebra, recent progress in theory and praxis has led to the proliferation
of nonlinear methods, notably for systems of multivariate polynomial equations.
So it is fair to say that these methods are now at the forefront of exciting developments.
</p>
<br>
<h2>My Vision</h2>
<p>
Following my firm belief that the tasks of designing innovative mathematical
software and of solving complex research problems using computational
methods are strongly mutually dependent, my ambitious goal is to
considerably push the computational boundaries of nonlinear algebra, notably
addressing polynomial system solving. Thus, applying the resulting algorithms and
corresponding software tools, we can solve challenging problems which have been
intractable so far in mathematics and applied sciences.
