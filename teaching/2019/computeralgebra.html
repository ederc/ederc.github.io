The lecture gives an introduction to basic concepts of computer algebra. In more
    detail, we will discuss the following topics:
<ol>
<li> Integer and polynomial arithmetics, fast multiplication, gcd
    computations, complexity of algorithms, modular techniques
</li>
<!-- <li> Systems of equations, Hermite- and Smith-normal form, p-adic
   - approximation, lattices, LLL algorithm.
   - </li> -->
<li> Resultants and extended gcd computations.
</li>
<li> Multivariate polynomials, Gr&ouml;bner bases for ideals and modules, modular
methods, Faug&egrave;re's F4 and F5 algorithm, syzygies, free resolutions.
</li>
<li> (Squarefree) Factorization, Hensel lifting, factorization with LLL,
    primality tests, factorization over algebraic number fields.
</li>
</ol>
Moreover, the lecture will also try to teach you how to use open source computer
algebra systems like Singular, Nemo, OSCAR, etc. and how to write your own small
algorithms for specific problems.
